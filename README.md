Not all the libraries have full-fledged public source books and information. Several stray Reading Halls provide only newspapers, periodicals and journals to the book lovers. The libraries of schools and colleges are restricted for their students only. Hence, collection of all the books of every field and individual choice would not be an easy task. But, collaboration of the (available) city libraries and the search for the availability of book in the library (also at nearest library) might ease the task, comparatively. Providing an open access system in an android application can ease the process. Along with this, the writers can also engage themselves on the same platform in a different section expressing their views in their area of interest.
